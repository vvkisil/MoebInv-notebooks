# MoebInv notebooks
A collections of notebooks on Lie-Möbius sphere geometry and MoebInv package. We discuss and discover mathematical aspects of the theory using the dedicated software.

See the [annotated Table of Contents](https://github.com/vvkisil/MoebInv-notebooks/blob/master/Table_of_contents.md) as a Jupyter notebook.


## Running MoebInv notebooks
The code from these notebooks can be executed at Google CoLab after the installation of MoebInv library by a couple of mouse clicks.

Specifically, open the notebook with [library installation instructions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vvkisil/MoebInv-notebooks/blob/master/Introduction/Software_installation_GUI_integration.ipynb) and execute one cells with scripts. Then you can run all other notebooks until your CoLab session will expire.

Alternatively these notebooks can be executed from  a [CodeOcean capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/7952650/tree).

## Main folders

 + [Introduction](Introduction) -- a collection of quick-start examples

 + [Geometry_of_cycles](Geometry_of_cycles) -- main collection of notebooks

 + [EPAL-v1](EPAL-v1) -- Notebooks with all computer-assisted solutions of exercises from [ [2] ](#[2]).

## Jupyter and MoebInv-GUI integration
There is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the MoebInv library. It allows to create and research geometrical constructions by mouse clicks. You may find a pre-compiled GUI binary distribution for your desktop platform at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/moebinv/files/binary/). 

There is bidirectional integration beetween Jupyter and GUI:

* From Jupyter (or any coding system in C++ or Python) use
``` python
F.save("my-figure-archive.gar")
```
to save GiNaC Gar archive. Later it can be loaded into GUI (or any other front-end, indeed).
* From GUI select
```
File → Export figure → Export Python script
```
in Main Menu and save the script file. Then it can be executed in the IPython or Jupyter cell.

Furthermore, to use such code as Jupyter notebook I recommend to post-process the generated Python script with [p2j (Python to Jupyter)](https://pypi.org/project/p2j/) utility.

Here is an
[Example](https://github.com/vvkisil/MoebInv-notebooks/blob/master/Introduction/Nine_point_auto_script.ipynb) or its [HTML view](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~kisilv/MoebInv-notebooks/Introduction/Nine_point_auto_script.html)
of a Python script and Jupyter notebook automatically created from the GUI.
